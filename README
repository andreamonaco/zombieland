__What is Zombieland?__

Zombieland is a working title for a game, a little MMO about the struggle for
survival of humans against zombies.



__The game doesn't run, where are the assets?__

They are currently not available.  I use non-free assets to write and test the
game, so I can't distribute them legally.  As soon as I find free assets or make
my own, I will ship them.



__How can I play Zombieland?__

Move around with the arrows, close the game with Esc.



__Can I test Zombieland locally?__

Yes.  After building, start first the server (zombielandd), then the client
(zombieland) on another terminal, the latter with 127.0.0.1 and any username as
arguments.  You can even run multiple clients on the same system.



__What is Zombieland capable to do?__

I tested Zombieland on a LAN and I confirmed that multiple players can move in a
little 2D map.



__On which platforms does Zombieland run?__

Zombieland is written in portable C and uses SDL2, SDL2_image and SDL2_ttf for
multimedia, so that part is fairly portable.
Networking code uses the Posix API, so consult the docs of your platform about
that.
The configure and build toolchain is autotools, but building is easy enough that
you can do it yourself.



__Does Zombieland work across architectures?__

Not yet probably: endianness conversions are still not applied consistently.  I
will fix this soon enough.



__How can I build Zombieland?__

If you have the dependencies installed (including the autotools), just do the
usual from the directory of the repository:

 $ autoreconf -fi && ./configure && make



__Why can't I shut down the server with Ctrl-C?__

I'm not sure, but probably reading sockets non-blockingly changes the default
handling of SIGINT.  I will look into it further.



__Does Zombieland contain any line of code written by AI?__

No!  This is a game about zombies, not written by zombies.
